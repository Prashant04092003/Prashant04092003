## Projects

**Credit Card Recommendation Engine**  
- Built a hybrid recommender combining segmentation, credit behavior, and FICO thresholds  
- Integrated SHAP-based explainability and deployed via Streamlit for interactive simulations

**Drug Efficacy Prediction**  
- Applied machine learning to gene expression data to classify drug response  
- Used PCA, feature engineering, and ensemble models to build a robust predictive pipeline

**Fraud Detection Using Graph & Tabular ML**  
- Processed 2.7M+ transactions, modeled MCC behavior, engineered usage-based features  
- Compared XGBoost and Random Forest, visualized results using SHAP and ROC-AUC

**NLP Chatbot for Internal Docs**  
- Built a retrieval-augmented QA system using n8n + LangChain on local vector stores  
- Tuned prompts for context awareness and multi-hop document understanding

**Customer Segmentation Pipeline**  
- Engineered user personas from category spend, frequency, income share, and utilization  
- Applied clustering (KMeans, hierarchical) to identify strategic segments for personalization
